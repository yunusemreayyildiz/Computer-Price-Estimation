# Computer Price Estimation & Device Classification

This project aims to predict computer prices using various hardware specifications and classify devices into their respective form factors (Laptop vs. Desktop types) using advanced Machine Learning techniques.1. Description of the ProblemThe goal is to provide a unified tool that can:Estimate Price: Predicting the market value of a computer based on its hardware (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.)1111.Classify Device Type: Automatically determining the form factor (e.g., Gaming, Ultrabook, Workstation for laptops; ATX, Mini-ITX for desktops) based on physical and performance attributes22222.2. Dataset and PreprocessingThe dataset underwent extensive cleaning and feature engineering to improve model performance:Missing Value Handling: Numeric features were filled using the median, and categorical features using the mode3.Outlier Removal: Extreme outliers were cleaned using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method4.Normalization: Price targets were log-transformed to handle skewness5.Feature Engineering: * Extracted PPI (Pixels Per Inch) from resolution and display size6.Developed a Unified Benchmark Score for CPUs and GPUs by analyzing family, generation, and performance tiers777777777.One-Hot Encoding was applied to categorical variables8.3. Environment SpecificationsTo run this project, you need the following environment:Python 3.xKey Libraries: scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.Refer to requirements.txt for exact versions.4. Model Details and MethodologyWe implemented a multi-stage modeling approach:Regression (Price Prediction):Models used: Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost99.Stacking Regressor: A combined model using RF, LGBM, CatBoost, and XGB with a Linear Regression final estimator for stable predictions10101010.Classification (Form Factor):Hierarchical Stacking: Specialized Random Forest base learners were used to output probability scores (Meta Features)111111111111111111.Final Blender: A Logistic Regression model makes the final decision based on these probabilities and engineered features like weight_log12121212.5. Model ResultsPrice Prediction Metrics (After Feature Engineering)The Stacking model outperformed individual models13:| Model | R-squared ($R^2$) | MAE | RMSE || :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- || Random Forest | 0.9288 | $114.85 | $150.73 || CatBoost | 0.9353 | $109.54 | $143.62 || Stacking (Best) | 0.9366 | $108.67 | $142.23 |Classification AccuracyLaptop Form Factor: 82.1% Accuracy (Stacked Model)14.Desktop Form Factor: 77.6% Accuracy (Stacked Model)15.Note: The model showed near-perfect performance (F1=1.00) for ATX and Full-Tower desktop cases16.6. Training & Inference VisualizationsCorrelation Heatmap: Identified RAM and GPU tier as high-impact features for price17171717.Actual vs. Predicted Plots: Visual comparison showing the significant improvement after feature engineering (from ~$R^2$ 0.79 to 0.93)18181818.Feature Importance: Revealed that weight_kg and cpu_threads are critical predictors for device classification19191919.
